## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|

### Using Outputs

```yaml
- name: Generate coverage report
  id: coverage
  uses: yshrsmz/kover-report-action@v1
  with:
    coverage-file: 'build/reports/kover/report.xml'

- name: Display coverage
  run: |
    echo "Coverage: ${{ steps.coverage.outputs.coverage-percentage }}%"
    echo "Lines covered: ${{ steps.coverage.outputs.lines-covered }}/${{ steps.coverage.outputs.lines-total }}"
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- pnpm

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Format code
pnpm run format

# Lint code
pnpm run lint

# Build the action
pnpm run build

# Run all checks
pnpm run all
```

### Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts          # Main action code
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js          # Compiled action (committed)
â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml            # Action metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.js          # ESLint configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .prettierrc.json      # Prettier configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json          # Node.js dependencies
```

### Building

The action uses [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to compile the TypeScript code and all dependencies into a single JavaScript file:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This creates `dist/index.js` which should be committed to the repository.
